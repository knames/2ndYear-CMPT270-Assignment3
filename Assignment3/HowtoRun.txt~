Execution:
In order to run this program, you must have all 4 files in the
same folder: 
	-BasicKennel.java
	-Driver.java
	-Person.java
	-Pet.java
From there, you can compile the program (javac *.java) in
terminal, and then run the Driver.java program (java Driver).

Status:
Everything is working. All methods are tested assuming 
proper input is given. If inproper input is given, methods will
return false or throw exceptions. In the future, if users are
allowed to give direct input, one would need to insert more checks
to catch inproper input.
